Have you ever wished to craft a chatbot tailored to your needs?

We'll walk you through the simple steps to build and deploy your own LLM-based chatbot using Hugging Face Spaces and Gradio—all in just five minutes, and absolutely free of charge!

Prerequisites
Before you start creating your chatbot, make sure you have the following:

A Hugging Face Account: Essential for accessing the platform where you'll build and host your chatbot. Sign up here.
Setup and Deployment
Choosing Your Chatbot’s Identity: Decide what your chatbot will specialize in. This could be anything from a chef, painter, or even a relaxing buddy to help you unwind. The role you choose will define the interactions and capabilities of your chatbot.

Logging into Hugging Face: Here, you'll need an account to access the tools required for deploying your chatbot. If you don't have an account, signing up is straightforward and quick.

Navigating to Hugging Face Spaces: Spaces are where the magic happens. This section of Hugging Face allows users to create and manage their applications seamlessly. Navigate to Spaces to get started.

Creating Your Space: Initiate a new space by clicking on 'Create New Space'. It’s important that the name of your Space reflects the chatbot's role, as it helps in identifying the application’s purpose at a glance.

Configuring Your Chatbot:

Selecting the Framework and Model: Choose 'Gradio' as the framework for its user-friendly interface capabilities, and select a suitable model, such as 'Zephyr 7B', known for its versatility across various tasks.
Customization: Here’s where you personalize the chatbot. Depending on the selected role, you might want to tailor system messages and interaction style. This customization will enable your chatbot to interact appropriately according to its role.
Deployment: Once setup is complete, deploy your chatbot by simply clicking the create button. Deployment usually takes a couple of minutes. After this, your chatbot will be up and running and ready to interact.

Customization Example
To make your chatbot truly unique, consider personalizing it extensively. For instance, if you choose a 'Relaxing Buddy' role:

Modify the system messages to include comforting phrases and stress-relief tips.
Program the chatbot to suggest relaxation exercises, guide through meditation sessions, or simply offer soothing conversations.
Explore different roles and tweak the system instructions to discover the full potential of your chatbot. Don’t forget to share your creations and experiences, as your insights could inspire others in their chatbot development.
